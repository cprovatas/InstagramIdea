OSX Instagram Feed Application - 07/1/16  
==============

This app is being designed as a result of the recent ban on Third-Party Instagram Apps, essentially forcing non-mobile users to use the Instagram website.  This app is set up to dynamically fetch your news feed and display it.  This app is in very early stages and only has some basic functionality working.  

**What it does right now**

- After logging in (you only need to log in once at the first time opening the app), the app will display the first 24 photos of yours news feed, along with the users, user profile picture, number of likes, and caption associated with those photos
- If the user's photo is a video, it will show the video instead in a video player.


**Features Looking Forward (In order of priority)**

- resizing the table's content view when the window is full screen

- better scaling of landscape images

- improve UI design

- display more photos after user has scrolled past 24 photos

- display other core information such as users that liked the photo, perhaps some of the other hidden json info, such as 'user has blocked user' etc

**Features Looking Farther Forward - These will probably be more difficult to implement w/o the instagram developer api**

- perhaps support for displaying a users profile with their pictures

- Ability to like/dislike photos/videos

- Ability to write comments

- display feed in different types of views (collection views etc)

- Some other things to think about - notifications, messages, account info, block users, reporting photos
